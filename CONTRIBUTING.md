## Contributing

This package is managed via npm so you will need to create a user and be added to the teamsnap org in order to publish updates.

Once your user is created and added to the org this guide details the steps to publish an update to npm.

**Note**

The sass-lint plugin is configured as a prepublish step so if there are linting errors you will need to resolve them before publishing.
